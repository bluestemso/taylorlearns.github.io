In the first video for my YouTube channel, [Practical Vibes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLYGNo70Obh7iT95tmTe1A), I show how to transform a raw CSV file into professional-looking PDF reports and documents using Cursor, the AI-powered code editor. This step-by-step tutorial demonstrates the "vibe coding" technique within Cursor, allowing you to quickly and easily generate formatted PDFs without complex coding.
